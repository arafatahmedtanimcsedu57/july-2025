		"On 19 July 2024, Rampura witnessed widespread violence as Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) personnel were deployed in this area to disperse the protestors and prevent them from entering the Bangladesh Television station. On the same day, a boy named Mohammad Ramzan was killed in the protest at Rampura DIT Road. He was a delivery boy at a local bakery shop. The digital forensics team at TGI has obtained a video of 01 minute and 45 seconds in length, which demonstrates the preceding and subsequent scenes of the killing of Mohammad Ramzan. In the video, Ramzan was observed wearing an orange-colored T-shirt, black jeans, and a pair of slippers. He was among the protesters and got shot in 50 seconds of the video. A thorough examination of the video indicates that the shot was a headshot, fired from a distance consistent with a rifle. Though he had been shot from the front where some BGB personnel were located at the beginning, his shooter is invisible in the video. Soon after Ramzan fell on the road, some protesters grabbed his hands and legs and took him to the Wapda Road. His blood was spattered on the road as he was dragged from the spot."
