Using open-source investigations, research, digital forensics, eyewitness accounts, and storytelling, we reconstruct the chronology of events with the aim of advancing truth, transitional justice, and accountability in the country. This archive serves as a public memorial to victims and survivors, and a valuable tool for researchers, journalists, and human rights defenders worldwide fighting for a more just, democratic, and rights-respecting society.",

      "The Monsoon Revolution Archive, a project of Tech Global Institute, was founded in 2024 to preserve documentation and unearth human rights violations and atrocities committed during Bangladesh's July Uprising. Documentation and archiving are central to criminal and human rights accountability processes. Still, they are often siloed, and archiving resources and technologies are concentrated in the Global North, despite gross abuses, wars, and conflicts being inflicted on communities in the Global Majority. Our work aims to build sociotechnical and legal capacities in Global Majority countries to advance domestic and international efforts around truth, justice, and accountability— and to contribute to open-source movements on war crimes and human rights abuse preservation. We focus on state-sanctioned abuses and crimes, particularly those related to the security sector, and are actively involved with numerous efforts on democratic reform and transitional justice in Bangladesh and elsewhere.",
