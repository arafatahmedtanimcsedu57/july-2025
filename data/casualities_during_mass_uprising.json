He had stepped out of his home after Asr prayers when he was hit by gunfire. Locals rushed him to the hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries. Given the volatile situation at the time, his father, Md. Shafayet Mia, brought the body back to their family graveyard and buried it without an autopsy. On August 20, 2024, Shafayet Mia filed a murder case naming former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as the principal accused alongside 91 others and 200-300 unnamed individuals.",
